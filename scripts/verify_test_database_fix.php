echo "=== Before Fix (Problem) ===\n";
echo "Issue: prepend.php called Base::getDB() with production config\n";
echo "       Tests tried to use Base::getDB() with test config\n";
echo "       But Base::\$db was already initialized with production database!\n";
echo "       Result: Tests wrote to production database 'dbmt3'\n\n";

echo "=== After Fix (Solution) ===\n";
echo "Added Base::getTestDB() method that uses separate static variable\n";
echo "Now production and test database connections are independent\n\n";

// Demonstrate the fix
$productionConfig = new MockProductionConfig();
$testConfig = new MockTestConfig();

echo "Production config database: {$productionConfig->dbName}\n";
echo "Test config database: {$testConfig->dbName}\n\n";

echo "=== How it works now ===\n";
echo "1. prepend.php calls Base::getDB(\$productionConfig)\n";
echo "   - Creates connection to 'dbmt3' and stores in Base::\$db\n\n";

echo "2. Tests call Base::getTestDB(\$testConfig)\n";
echo "   - Creates separate connection to 'dbmt3_test' and stores in Base::\$testDb\n\n";

echo "3. Both connections coexist independently:\n";
echo "   - Base::\$db points to production database\n";
echo "   - Base::\$testDb points to test database\n\n";

echo "=== Key Benefits ===\n";
echo "✅ Production code continues to work unchanged\n";
echo "✅ Tests now use proper test database\n";
echo "✅ No interference between production and test connections\n";
echo "✅ Simple, elegant solution that follows existing patterns\n\n";

echo "=== Next Steps ===\n";
echo "Run 'php composer.phar run test' on Dreamhost to verify tests now use dbmt3_test\n";
echo "Tests should pass without writing to production database dbmt3\n";
