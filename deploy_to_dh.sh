# A site cloned from new-DH-user-site fills in DEST and DEST_PATH below and
# commits them.

# The template repo itself is the one exception: it must keep "example" here,
# so it hides its own filled-in copy with

# This only updates an installed site. The first install is by git too: see
# README.md, *First install* (init, remote, fetch, checkout in the directory the
# panel made; never rsync the tree). The setup-this-new-site skill drives it.
